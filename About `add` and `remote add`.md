# About things done locally and remotely

## Samples
### Things done locally
* Create a branch: `git init -b <branch_name>`
* *Add* local files into the git branch: `git add .`

### Things done remotely  
* Commit an update: `git commit -m <msg>`
* *Add* `origin` to remote repo, which is created earlier online: `git remote add origin <url>`

## Note
* There are two Italic *add* in former code. They are different.  
The first `add` is a `git` command, which is done locally.  
The second `add` is a note of `git remote` command, which is done remotely.
